  1. Set the `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` via your CircleCI project settings or
     create a context containing it.
  2. In the job that needs a tailscale VPN connection, run the
     `circleci-tailscale/connect` step.
     - Make sure that job uses the context with `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY`,
       if you use contexts instead of project settings.
